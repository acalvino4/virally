It was my first time implementing a full-scale authentication system, as well as my first time utilizing the SQLAlchemy ORM.

On a small note, I also used a native css variable for the first time here. (I have used sass variables, as my preference is generally to work with bootstrap.)

Some other interesting features that I worked though are
* implementing a many-to-many self-referential database relationship in SQLAlchemy
* dealing with all data exchange through form submission rather than ajax
* rerouting after login or a post request based on a 'next' url query parameter
