It was my first time implementing a full-scale authentication system, as well as my first time utilizing the SQLAlchemy ORM.

On a small note, I also used a native css variable for the first time here.

Some other interesting features that I worked though are
* implementing a many-to-many self-referential database relationship in SQLAlchemy
* dealing with all data exchange through form submission rather than ajax
